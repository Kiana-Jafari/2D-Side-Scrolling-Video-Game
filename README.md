### 2D Side-Scrolling Video Game

Welcome to the 2D Side-Scrolling Game Project! 🎮 
This project showcases a beginner-friendly game environment built with **HTML5 Canvas** and **p5.js**, an open-source JavaScript library.

Here's what you can explore so far:

- **Sprite class**: Manages visual objects in 2D space
- **Animation support**: Supports animation

- **Sprite grouping**: Supports grouping sprites
- **Mouse and keyboard interactions**: Supports mouse and keyboard interactions
- **Virtual camera**: Supports a virtual camera
- **Sound Effects (SFX)**: Supports all the sounds that objects make in the game

A general overview of the project:

- Designing and implementing a creative 2D game environment with animated character movement
- Utilizing p5.js and JavaScript for real-time rendering to create a dynamic, side-scrolling world with interactive animations
- Successfully delivering a functional game demo that showcases user experience and animation transitions

Please note that the project is still in progress, but a short demo is available in the files section. You can also see a preview as provided below:
